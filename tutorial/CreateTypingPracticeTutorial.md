It is pretty simple to create the current application. Let's go through step by step.
## Index.html
First of all, it's required to create index.html and some basic structure inside.
Look at required scripts:

### Body tag
Inside body tag create div with class container. Container has areas for displaying some text and for typing. Below there's also space for some information. It's in div with id info.

You see inside div info three divs with appropriate id. Divs for display and for typing are created the same. Autofocus on input textarea means when the page loads, it will be focus on the textarea.
### Navbar
To create navbar I used the following code:

I will mention important part of this code: div with id alatoo and list with id funfactsrandom. Div is empty, it will be filled by lists by jquery.
List with id funfactsrandom is on the navbar on the top, when you press on the text related to this list, JS code will be implemented.
